Badgers are found in much of North America, Great Britain,[15] Ireland and most of the rest of Europe as far north as southern Scandinavia.[16] They live as far east as Japan, Korea and China. The Javan ferret-badger lives in Indonesia,[17] and the Bornean ferret-badger lives in Malaysia.[18] The honey badger is found in most of sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Desert, southern Levant, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and India.
